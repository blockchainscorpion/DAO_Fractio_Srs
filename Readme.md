# Fractio DAO Platform

A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) implementation for tokenized real estate and agricultural assets, built with Solidity smart contracts and a modular vanilla JS frontend.

## Overview

This platform enables:
- Decentralized governance for real estate and agricultural investments
- Tokenized asset management
- Membership controls with KYC verification
- Proposal creation and voting system
- Token-based voting power delegation

🔜 Upcoming Integration: ERC-3643
As a solo developer focused on security and regulatory compliance, I'm working to integrate the ERC-3643 security token standard. This will enhance:

Regulatory Compliance

- Built-in KYC/AML checks
- Jurisdiction-based transfer restrictions
- Accredited investor verification


Enhanced Security

- Identity-based token transfers
- Multi-signature operations
- Automated compliance checks


Non-Web3 User Support

- Traditional payment gateway integration
- Custodial wallet solutions
- Fiat on/off ramps



🤝 Call for Contributors

## Smart Contracts

### Governance.sol
Main DAO contract that handles:
- Membership management (add/remove members, KYC status)
- Proposal creation and voting
- Vote delegation
- Admin controls

### GovernanceToken.sol
ERC20-compliant token that:
- Represents voting power
- Enforces KYC requirements
- Manages token transfers
- Handles minting permissions

## Setup Instructions

1. Install Dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Install Truffle globally:
```bash
npm install -g truffle
```

3. Start local blockchain (Ganache):
```bash
truffle develop
```

4. Compile contracts:
```bash
truffle compile
```

5. Run migrations:
```bash
truffle migrate
```

6. Run tests:
```bash
truffle test
```

## Frontend Development

The frontend is built with vanilla JavaScript and utilizes Web3.js (due to truffle) for blockchain interactions. Key features:

- Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Event-driven updates using custom EventEmitter
- Comprehensive error handling
- Extensive testing framework

### Core Modules

- `web3Setup.js`: Handles Web3 initialization and network management
- `contractManager.js`: Manages smart contract instances and interactions
- `daoManager.js`: Coordinates DAO-specific functionality
- `userManagement.js`: Handles member management operations

### Running the Frontend

1. Serve the `client` directory using a local server
2. Ensure MetaMask is installed and connected to your local Ganache network
3. Access through `localhost:port`

## Testing

### Smart Contract Tests

Run Truffle tests:
```bash
truffle test
```

### Frontend Tests

Run the test suite:
```javascript
// In browser console
const tester = new DAOTester();
await tester.initialize();
```

## Security Considerations

1. Access Control
- Role-based permissions using OpenZeppelin's AccessControl
- KYC requirements for token transfers
- Admin-only sensitive operations

2. Transaction Safety
- Gas estimation for all transactions
- Comprehensive error handling
- State verification before operations
